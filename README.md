# ENet-Real-Time-Semantic-Segmentation

A Neural Net Architecture for real time Semantic Segmentation. <br/>
In this repository we have reproduced the ENet Paper - Which can be used on
mobile devices for real time semantic segmentattion. The link to the paper can be found here: [ENet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02147.pdf)
